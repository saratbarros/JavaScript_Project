## About this project
- Create a blank HTML document with a script tag (Hint: it is best practice to link an
external .js file). This game is going to be played completely from the console, so don’t
worry about putting anything else in there.
- Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called
computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. We’ll use this
function in the game to make the computer’s play. Tip: use the console to make sure this
is returning the expected output before moving to the next step!
- Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should
take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a
string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock".
